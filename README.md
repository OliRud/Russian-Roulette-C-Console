A C# version of my python russian roulette script, as im trying to learn it at the moment.

Source code can be found in Program.cs

For those who dont know how to play:

  First person to get the opponent killed wins.

  You can either spin, pull the trigger, or fire at the opponent and then shoot yourself


The chamber is decided through chooseing a random number between 1 to 6, and then reducing it by 1 whenever the trigger is pulled. (So 0 would mean death)

anyways have fun :DDDD
